# hello-world

Hello world is a common phrase used in programming to test basic programs. It is usually performed by newcommers as an small app that displays this text. It is maybe the programming equivalent of saying "one, two, three..." on a microphone.

## Who Am I?

I'm a hobbyist programmer aiming to become a full stack developer. It is a high bar for sure, but I'm confident that my patience and persistence will drive me to achieve that goal. At this moment I have under my belt the following programming languages:
* C++
* Visual Basic .Net, VB6, and VBA
* JavaScript
* Java
* C#
* BASIC

I also know other non-programming languages like html and css. Lastly I'm well versed to in Regular Expressions (PCRE).

Programming is what I like the most but I have passion for other subjects too. I like math (specially geometry) in fact most of the programs that I make mostly deal with math and/or geometry. I also like to create graphics in computer through various methods like photomanipulation, vector graphics, 3d modeling, and pixel level editing (aka pixel arts). I also like photography but unfortunately I have not had in my hands a decent camera in a while.

## What Kinds of Programs Can I Find in Your Repository

I'm still learning more complex techniques of programming and my github is quite recent, so as of right now you can find most my labs in my recent classes and a few other personal projects that I came up on my own. I'm still trying to organize my older projects so that I can upload them too here.

## Miscellaneous

Most of my projects here come with their respective executable, which you can access opening the respective repository and then right under the tabs where the `<> Code` tab is you'll find a bar that has a handful of options. Among which you can find one called `Releases`.
