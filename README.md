# hello-world

I'm a hobbyist programmer aiming to become a full stack developer. I know that is a very high bar for where I'm standing at the moment, but I'm confident that my patience and persistence will drive me to achieve my goals.

My main languages are Visual Basic and C++. I'm learning web scripting and HTML too at the moment.
